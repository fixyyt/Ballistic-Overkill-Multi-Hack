# Ballistic-Overkill-Multi-Hack
Basic cheats.

Before doing anything with code replace BallisticCore.dll and Assembly-Sharp.dll files from bin/Debug into your game file folder.

Without that cheats wont work -> lots of errors that we can't access code/memory.

Inection:

1. Download https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/unity/408878-sharpmonoinjector-fixed-updated.html
2. Open Ballistic Overkill and injector
3. Refresh process
4. Select Loader.cs.dll in Assembly to inject field
5. Set Class name to Loader
6. Set Method name to Init
7. Browse game, than inject the cheat



If you want to add something try finding potentional exploitations using dnSpy, searching in BallisticCore.dll / Assembly-Sharp.dll

I would love to see your changes -> Discord: Fixy#8265

enjoy :)
